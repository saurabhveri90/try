Setting up AEM and installing modules locally involves several steps, including setting up a local AEM environment and deploying packages to it. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to do this:

Step 1: Set Up a Local AEM Environment
Install Java: Ensure Java is installed on your system. For AEM 6.5 and later, use Java JDK 11; for earlier versions, use JDK 816.

Download AEM QuickStart Jar: Obtain the AEM QuickStart Jar and a license file from Adobe.

Create Folder Structure: Organize your files as follows:

text
~/aem-sdk
/author
/publish
Configure AEM Instances:

Rename the QuickStart Jar to aem-author-p4502.jar and place it in the /author directory.

Add the license.properties file to the /author directory.

Repeat this process for the Publish instance (aem-publish-p4503.jar) in the /publish directory14.

Start AEM Instances:

Double-click the Jar files or use the command line to start the instances:

bash
java -jar aem-author-p4502.jar
Step 2: Install Modules Locally
Use Maven for Deployment: If you're using a Maven project, ensure you have the necessary profiles set up to deploy packages to your local AEM instance.

Deploy Packages:

Use Maven commands like mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage to deploy packages to your local AEM instance running on port 45025.

Verify Deployment:

Navigate to the AEM Package Manager (http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp) to verify that packages have been installed correctly5.

Example Commands
Start AEM Author Instance:

bash
java -jar aem-author-p4502.jar
Deploy Packages with Maven:

bash
mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
By following these steps, you can set up a local AEM environment and install modules locally, ensuring that your development environment is properly configured for AEM development.
